To whom it may concern,

This is purely an exercise in orientation and familiarization with the features of GitHub. As such there is nothing meaningful to say in this documentation and the text contained herein represents nothing more than a kind of place-filler. I shall attempt to transcribe Sonnet 18 from memory:

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer's lease hath all too short a date

Sometime, too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd

But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growest

So long as men can breathe and eyes can see
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee

/End of attempt
